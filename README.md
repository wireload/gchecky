=======

WireLoad's fork of [gchecky](https://code.google.com/p/gchecky/).

Installation
============
Installation should be as easy as typing:

    $ python setup.py install

If you get an error similar to:

    The required version of setuptools (>=0.6c7) is not available, and
    can't be installed while this script is running. Please install
    a more recent version first.

Then try running:

    $ sudo python ez_setup.py

This should install/update setuptools on your system. If you don't have root
privileges then you should try to install and use setuptools locally.
Something like:

    $ export PYTHONPATH
    $ python ez_setup.py setuptools --install-dir=<the_location>

Be sure to permanently add <the_location> to your python path (for example
via PYTHONPATH environment variable).

Documentation
=============
To generate documentation use epydoc packages:

    $ cd /path/to/gchecky
    $ epydoc --html -o docs gchecky

Read epydoc manual for other output formats and options:

    $ epydoc -h

To install epydoc package on:

    $ sudo easy_install epydoc

or to some local directory:

    $ easy_install --install-dir=<the_location> epydoc

or download the installation package from [Epydoc](http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/) and follow the instructions.
